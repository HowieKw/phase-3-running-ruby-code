# p method helps console an array by calling the .inspect method on it
# ruby will try to coerce data to a string by calling the .to_s method
p [1, 2, 3]


# Ruby has one more method, pp, for "pretty-printing" complex data, 
# such as nested arrays and hashes (the Ruby equivalent of a JavaScript object)
# pp [{ id: 1, hello: "World" }, { id: 2, hello: "Ruby" }, { id: 3, hello: "Moon" }, { id: 4, hello: "Learner" }]
